              <p>
                Aspiring Software Engineer, I recently completed a life-changing six-week course in HTML and CSS programming at <span style="color: rgb(32, 31, 31);"> <b>Xtech Minds</b></span>. 
                This challenging exercise not only helped me to fix the basics of web development in my mind but has given me further passion for creating visually stunning and highly functional websites. I was deeply introduced through the course to all the depths of HTML when it comes to structuring web content and the power of CSS in improving aesthetics and user experience. Each week brought new challenges and projects that helped me apply knowledge both practically and creatively. By the end of the program, I had built a robust portfolio of web projects showing my skills and progress. To this very day, this has been invaluable in setting me on the path toward a successful career in software engineering by giving me confidence and expertise to dive into more advanced technologies and development projects.
